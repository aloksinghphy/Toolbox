# Toolbox
This computational tool designed for refractive index sensor to  simulating the sensitivity, figure of merit, quality factor, FWHM, and  scattering of electromagnetic radiation by core-shell spherical nanoparticle  and nanomatryoshya. 
This version consist of “Nanoscattering” and “Nanosensor” modules which contains tools for analyzing and simulating optical properties e.g., scattering/extinction/absorption spectra of nanoparticle based plasmonic systems. Nanosensor module is equipped to design nanoparticle based plasmonic sensors. Currently, the toolbox can simulate nanosphere, nanoshell and nanomatryoshka based geometries.

 

Capabilities

C1. Mie scattering theory based computation of scattering/extinction/absorption spectra of plasmonic nanoparticle systems based on different materials.

C2. The analysis is applicable to small as well as large size nanoparticles.

C3. Built-in plasmonic materials e.g., Au, Ag. Cu, Al, TiN, HfN, ZrN, Graphene. C4. In addition to built-in materials, the toolbox provide an option to the user for adding a material of his/her choice.

C5. Equipped to deal with 2-D grapheme. The effect of chemical potential and graphene thickness can be analyzed.
